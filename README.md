Consumer class that will consume messages from kafka topic. Here, the Url of the test document.
   - **Download** </br>
   Method to download pdf from the url.
   - **Read PDF** </br>
   Read the pdf and convert it to raw text, so that details could be extracted from it. For this **Apache PDFBox** is used.
   - **Call Perform Check** </br>
   After Reading the pdf, the raw text is sent to CheckIBAN method of Perform Check class. This Perform Check class can have other checks in future.    
4. **Perform Check** </br>
Perform Check can have various checks. For this implementation, only IBAN check is implemented.
  - **IBAN Check** </br>
    From the raw text of PDF IBAN is extracted using **RegEx**.</br>
